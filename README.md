# TicTacToe

Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses) is a classic game for two players named X and O, who take turns marking the empty spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. Whichever player first succeeds in marking either an entire row, a column, or a diagonal is considered the winner.

The game is built without the use of any open-source graphic libraries or game engines. Implemented essential utility using C++ to support the implementation of the game.

### Features include:
- **Multiple modes:**
  - Two-player mode
  - Play with AI mode
- **AI Algorithm:**
  - AI is built using Mini-Max Algorithm, combined with Alpha-Beta pruning to decrease the number of evaluated nodes, thereby increasing efficiency.
- **Navigation:**
  - Clicking Escape returns the player from any non-Menu scene back to the Menu.
  - To exit the game: Can select the Exit option provided in the Menu. Alternatively, one can also click Escape when in the Menu.
- **User Experience:**
  - Colored content, instructions, and symbols to provide an optimal user experience for a game developed with no graphic support.
  - For invalid user inputs, explicit instructions are conveyed to the user to understand what they might have done wrong. Please refer to "handling invalid user inputs" below for a sample.
  - Whenever a player wins, the line which caused the win is toggled till the user interrupts.
  - In AI mode, using Sleep() to give the user the same feel that they get when playing with another human player.
